[00:08.65] What do you have in store?
[00:09.94] One life away, we can't explore
[00:11.90] But I don't want to get in the way no more
[00:13.86] 'Cause this the type of feeling you can't ignore, ay
[00:39.86] 
[00:16.31] I'm ready to break down the door
[00:17.97] Settle the score, I can't let you go away
[00:20.53] I miss the smile off your face
[00:22.38] You know that I lo-lo-lo-love the chase
[00:41.88] 
[00:24.41] You told me once that I was crazy
[00:26.14] I said, "Baby girl, I know"
[00:29.32] But I can't let you go away
[00:30.31] So don't you get me started now
[00:32.56] I want a yes, I don't want maybes
[00:34.06] 'Cause they leave me where you found me
[00:38.75] So don't leave
[00:45.75] 
[00:40.01] Ooh, I just love the way you got me feeling
[00:45.27] And now I can feel it
[00:46.72] It's like, ooh
[00:50.09] Take away the pain, baby, I'm healing
[00:53.23] Baby, I'm healing
[00:56.12] I don't need anything more
[00:59.87] Be the wave, I'll be the shore
[01:03.79] Crashing all over me, I want you (fire)
[01:23.29] 
[01:12.20] What do you have in store?
[01:13.71] Type of girl that make me drop dead on the floor
[01:15.82] This the only girl that I love and adore
[01:17.83] This the type of love that you can't ignore
[01:39.33] 
[01:19.50] I said, "Hey, she comin' my way"
[01:21.69] She runnin' 'round sayin' whatever she wanna say
[01:23.96] I told her I don't wanna have to do this every day
[01:25.76] Told her that I love her, but she thinkin' it's a game
[01:52.76] 
[01:27.74] Oh, no, now she uncomfortable
[01:29.81] Never wanna make it for one-dimensional
[01:31.27] Oh, yeah, oh, nah-nah-nah
[01:33.91] Don't know how we got here
[01:34.82] Don't you get me started now
[01:48.82] 
[01:36.04] You told me once that I was crazy
[01:37.74] I said, "Baby girl, I know"
[01:41.01] But I can't let you go away
[01:42.35] So don't you get me started now
[01:44.28] I want a yes, I don't want maybes
[01:46.23] 'Cause they leave me where you found me
[01:50.46] So don't leave
[01:57.46] 
[01:51.95] Ooh, I just love the way you got me feeling (oh, it got me feeling)
[01:56.79] And now I can feel it (oh, it got me feeling)
[01:58.82] It's like, ooh
[02:01.66] Take away the pain, baby, I'm healing (baby, I'm healing)
[02:05.17] Baby, I'm healing (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[02:07.45] I don't need anything more (oh)
[02:11.67] Be the wave, I'll be the shore (oh)
[02:15.60] Crashing all over me, I want you (oh, yeah, ah)

[02:26.97] I can feel it, feel it
